  <h3>HERE IS MY JOURNEY AS FOREX TRADING NOMAD</h3>
  <p>I’m Naren Raj, A Telecom Engineer by profession, Have you ever wondered how your cell phone works around the clock? In spite of many constructions and tall buildings. Ask your friend who is working in Telecom,

A Telecom Engineer always works around the clock, keeps the link up and running,

Like a platoon never sleeps on the border.

I too had no holidays on any occasion or celebration except a half-yearly party from the office.</p>

<p>
<h3>Tired, Boredom of the same lifestyle</h3>

Traveling 1500Miles a year with heavy electronic testing devices.

I know a common question asked when I travel in public transport with heavy baggage.

Replied with frustration all the time

But I remember this one guy who transformed me, he was well dressed, looked like a software professional with a laptop, and asked the same question full of surprise, without taking off his eyes from my heavy baggage.

Sometimes he introduced himself as a financial planner.

I was blankly looking at him.

He again said Investment advisor.

I nodded my head sideways,

He said stock market buying and selling of company shares and trading


<h3>Completely alien words for me, i did not at all understand any word that came out of his mouth BUY SELL SHARES CURRENCIES, etc….etc…..
I expressed my feeling to him that “i did not understand anything at all”</h3>


In reply, he asked me a question.

Who do you think earns more between a civil engineer and labor working under him.

Of course, it’s the civil engineer.

He quickly replied with a smile “YES” because he works smarter than the laborers.

He draws beautiful homes on paper and makes money smartly,

But labor builds home brick by brick working hard and makes money less than him.

Just like all of you


<h3>I TOO HAD LOTS OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FOREX TRADING.
Trading is like gambling; Need huge money to participate</h3>

You required luck to make money in the market,

The market can be easily manipulated. Bla… Bla… Bla…

I’m pretty sure you have heard much more than this.

But trust me all the above statements and what you are hearing/heard is COMPLETELY WRONG.

When I lost all my investments and earnings.

I too have come across situations to quit trading and return back to my telecom profession.

I was completely broken, shattered, the world on my shoulder.

<h3>HERE IS WHAT CHANGED MY LIFE</h3>


I remember this incident happened on the last day of my car driving school.

we were subjected to drive the car with the senior traffic examiner

To get the driving license we should follow the instruction given by the senior traffic examiner

I was sitting in the passenger seat; another student from my driving school was in the driving seat with the examiner beside me.

Just after sometimes when the examiner asked to stop the car this student just overturned the car and out of anxiety she stamped on to the breaks. Resulting in disqualification for a driving license, she was shivering and did not know what just happened.

But I knew what happened, All these days we practiced with the aged old cars.

and what we drove on the final day with the examiner was the brand new car with soft pedals and power steering was entirely new to us.

<h3>HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT,</h3>
she started blaming the car for her disqualification, she started giving justification like breaks were so sensitive, steering is not good.

Roads were too narrow; the examiner told her to stop the car and did not give time, all the ways to prove she was right. But tutor told something which hit my head like a rock from the sky,

He said, Go learn how to drive a car first.

Don’t blame the car for your loss; just accept that you don’t know how to drive.WOW, what a great thought, I don’t know whether she understood or not, But I understood something very important that day. I came back home and resumed my studies on how to drive the market well.

I decided I will not blame the market for my loss, I blamed myself for my loss and started to learn how to drive the market, Any profession requires time just like a doctor, lawyer, and engineer

To become a doctor & lawyer you required at least 16 years, Similarly</p>
